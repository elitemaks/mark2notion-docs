## Response Structure

The `markdown` field in the response is an object that separates parent and child page content:

- **`parent`**: Contains the main page's Markdown content
- **`[Child Page Title]`**: If the page has child pages, each will be a separate property named after the child page title, containing that child's Markdown content

This structure allows you to:
- Access the main content via `data.markdown.parent`
- Iterate over child pages if they exist
- Maintain the hierarchy of your Notion page structure

## Usage Notes

<Info>
Each notion-to-markdown request counts as 1 API call against your quota, regardless of the page size or number of child pages.
</Info>

<Tip>
The endpoint returns standard Markdown that's compatible with GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) and most Markdown processors.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Make sure your Notion integration has been granted access to the page you want to convert. Pages must be explicitly shared with your integration. Child pages will only be included if your integration has access to them as well.
</Warning>

## Setup Guide

To use this endpoint, you need a Notion integration token:

1. Go to [https://www.notion.so/my-integrations](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations)
2. Click "New integration"
3. Give it a name and select the workspace
4. Copy the "Internal Integration Token" (starts with `secret_`)
5. Share the pages you want to convert with this integration
